        explanation: Explain why the final answer is correct or incorrect based on the correct explanation. Focus only on whether there are substantial differences between the final answer and the correct answer, do not comment on the background of the question, do not attempt to solve it again, do not defend any answers that are different from the correct answer, and only focus on judging whether the answers are consistent.
