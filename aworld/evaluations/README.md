# AWorld Evaluations Module

The `aworld.evaluations` module is the framework-owned evaluation substrate for AWorld. It supports both legacy
`EvaluationConfig`-driven flows and newer suite-backed evaluator flows that can execute an agent, task, or trusted
program callable first, then score final outcomes and normalized trajectory/process quality from a single execution
state.

## Core Components

### EvalTarget

`EvalTarget` is an abstract base class that defines the interface for objects to be evaluated. It provides a `predict`
method that should be implemented by subclasses to execute the model or agent and return results.

```python
class EvalTarget(abc.ABC, Generic[EvalCaseDataType]):
    def __init__(self, eval_config: EvaluationConfig = None):
        self.eval_config = eval_config or EvaluationConfig()

    @abc.abstractmethod
    async def predict(self, index: int, input: EvalDataCase[EvalCaseDataType]) -> dict:
        """Execute the llm/agent and return results."""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

### Scorer

`Scorer` is an abstract base class for evaluation scorers. It provides methods to score results against predefined
criteria and summarize scores across multiple evaluation cases.

```python
class Scorer(abc.ABC, Generic[EvalCaseDataType]):
    def __init__(self, name: str = None, eval_config: EvaluationConfig = None):
        self.name = name or self.__class__.__name__
        self.eval_criterias = {}
        self.eval_config = eval_config or EvaluationConfig()

    @abc.abstractmethod
    async def score(self, index: int, input: EvalDataCase[EvalCaseDataType], output: dict) -> ScorerResult:
        """Score the execute result."""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

### Evaluator

`Evaluator` coordinates the evaluation process by running evaluation cases through the target and applying scorers to
the results. It supports parallel execution and repeated runs for statistical robustness.

### EvalCriteria

`EvalCriteria` defines the metrics and thresholds for evaluation, including scoring rubrics, value ranges, and pass/fail
conditions.

```python
@dataclass
class EvalCriteria:
    metric_name: str = field(default_factory=str)
    scorer_class: Optional[str] = field(default_factory=str)
    scorer_params: Optional[dict] = field(default_factory=dict)
    prompt: str = field(default_factory=str)
    max_value: float = field(default=float('inf'))
    min_value: float = field(default=-float('inf'))
    threshold: float = field(default=0.0)
```

### EvalDataset and EvalDataCase

`EvalDataset` represents a collection of evaluation cases, while `EvalDataCase` represents a single evaluation instance
with input data.

### EvalResult

`EvalResult` captures the outcomes of an evaluation run, including individual case results and summary statistics.

### Suite-Backed Evaluation Definitions

Suite-backed evaluation adds a definition layer on top of the existing runtime skeleton:

- `EvalSuiteDef`: suite identity, cases, judge schema, gate policy, trajectory scorers, toolset hints, execution spec
- `EvalCaseDef`: input plus optional expected output and per-case runtime hints
- `EvalHarnessDef`: reusable execution defaults for suite-backed flows
- `EvalExecutionSpec`: runtime execution mode and target/task configuration
- `EvalState`: normalized execution result containing final answer, completion view, trajectory, usage, timing, and errors

These live under `aworld/evaluations/**`, not in `aworld-cli`, so the same substrate can be reused by framework callers,
official CLI flows, and custom evaluation agents.

Ownership is explicit:

- suite and case definitions own evaluation intent: input, expected outcome, task-domain tool hints, tags, and judge/gate semantics
- harnesses and execution specs own runtime behavior: whether execution is static, agent-backed, task-backed, or program-backed, plus task/runner configuration
- `aworld-cli` only assembles workspace inputs into these framework objects; it does not redefine evaluator semantics

Declarative JSON manifests are intentionally narrower than in-memory framework APIs. They do not accept `execution`,
`target_ref`, `task_builder_ref`, live agent/task objects, or program callables. In-memory callers may still pass live
AWorld agent/task instances through `EvalExecutionSpec.target_config` for compatibility, but that is not a persisted
suite contract.

`EvalState` intentionally separates:

- `answer`: the final deliverable or normalized terminal answer
- `completion`: completion-oriented view used by outcome scorers that only care about the final assistant output
- `trajectory`: captured execution history used by process, tool-use, and efficiency scorers

## Scorers

### Scorer Registry

The scorer registry provides a centralized mechanism for registering and retrieving scorers. It supports automatic
registration using decorators and mapping between metrics and their associated scorers.

```python
@scorer_register(MetricNames.ANSWER_ACCURACY)
class AnswerAccuracyLLMScorer(LLMAsJudgeScorer):
# Implementation details
```

### LLM as Judge

The `LLMAsJudgeScorer` class enables using language models as evaluators. It provides a framework for building prompts,
sending them to a judge model, and interpreting the results.

```python
class LLMAsJudgeScorer(Scorer, Generic[EvalCaseDataType]):
    def __init__(self, model_config: ModelConfig = None):
        super().__init__()
        self.model_config = model_config or ModelConfig(...)

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def build_judge_prompt(self, index: int, input: EvalDataCase[EvalCaseDataType], output: dict) -> str:
        """Builds a prompt for the judge model."""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

### Built-in Scorers

The module includes several pre-built scorers for common evaluation tasks:

- **AnswerAccuracyLLMScorer**: Evaluates the accuracy of answers against reference solutions
- **LabelDistribution**: Analyzes the distribution of labels in model outputs
- **SummarizeQuality**: Assesses the quality of generated summaries
- And more...

### Execution-State Helpers

`aworld.evaluations.scorers.state_extractors` provides reusable helpers for execution-backed scoring:

- `get_eval_state(output)`
- `get_completion(output)`
- `get_assistant_messages(output)`
- `get_messages_by_role(output, role)`
- `get_tool_calls(output)`
- `get_trajectory(output)`

Use these helpers instead of hand-parsing raw trajectory payloads in every scorer.

## Evaluation Targets

### AworldAgentEvalTarget

`AworldAgentEvalTarget` enables evaluating AWorld agents by running them on evaluation datasets and capturing their
responses. In execution-backed flows it returns both the final answer and a normalized `state` payload.

```python
class AworldAgentEvalTarget(EvalTarget[dict]):
    def __init__(self, agent: Optional[Agent] = None, agent_config: Optional[dict | str] = None,
                 query_column: str = 'query'):

    # Initialization logic

    async def predict(self, index: int, input: EvalDataCase[dict]) -> dict:
# Agent execution logic
```

### AworldTaskEvalTarget

`AworldTaskEvalTarget` provides a framework for evaluating task-based systems by building and running tasks for each
evaluation case. In execution-backed flows it normalizes `TaskResponse` output into `EvalState`.

## Execution-Backed Suite Evaluation

Execution-backed suite flows reuse the existing AWorld runtime instead of introducing a parallel evaluator stack:

- suite/case definitions specify what is being evaluated
- `EvalExecutionSpec` specifies how runtime execution happens
- `EvalTarget -> Evaluator -> EvaluateRunner` remains the core orchestration skeleton
- scorers read normalized execution state for outcome and trajectory evaluation

The current execution modes are:

- `static`: judge-only evaluation with no runtime execution
- `agent`: execute through `AworldAgentEvalTarget`
- `task`: execute through `AworldTaskEvalTarget`
- `program`: execute a trusted importable callable through the evaluator adapter layer and normalize the result into `EvalState`

This gives AWorld a framework-native evaluator path that can assess final artifacts, structured outputs, and captured
trajectory quality through one substrate. It is a single-shot evaluator flow: rollout-owning harnesses, user simulators,
lifecycle hooks, child-state composition, and step-level training rewards are separate runtime-composition work.

`program` and TASK builder references are trusted in-process extension points. Importing a module can execute top-level
code, so these references should only point at evaluator code controlled by the runner or workspace owner. They are not
sandboxed and are not exposed through declared JSON manifests.

Suite-backed evaluation also supports:

- typed judge schemas: Pydantic-backed validation with JSON schema export and required-field compatibility
- composite gates: structured metric conditions with `pass`, `fail`, and `needs_approval` outcomes
- trajectory scorers: suite-declared process metrics that lower into normal evaluator criteria and reports

## Suite, Case, and Execution Mapping

The evaluator v2 path is intentionally close to AWorld's existing runner model:

- suite -> describes the evaluation contract and default gate/judge behavior
- case -> provides per-row input, optional references, and case-local execution hints
- lightweight harness / execution spec -> describes how a case becomes a runnable AWorld execution
- eval target -> adapts the execution spec into an existing target implementation
- evaluator / runner -> executes cases and produces normalized outputs
- scorers -> read final answer, completion, and trajectory from `EvalState`

In practice this means outcome evaluation and trajectory evaluation share one execution pipeline. A suite can score only
the final artifact, only the captured trajectory, or both. The lightweight harness boundary selects execution defaults
and adapters; it does not own multi-turn rollout lifecycle in this version.

## Recorder

The runtime system includes recorders for handling evaluation runs, datasets, and results, with default implementations
that can be extended or replaced as needed:

- **EvalRunRecorder**: Manages evaluation runs and their metadata
- **EvalDatasetRecorder**: Handles dataset loading and storage
- **EvalResultRecorder**: Manages result persistence and retrieval

## Evaluation Runner

`EvalRunner` orchestrates the complete evaluation process, including loading datasets, creating evaluation runs,
executing evaluations, and saving results.

```python
from aworld.core.task import Runner

class EvaluateRunner(Runner):
    async def do_run(self) -> EvalResult:
        """Run the evaluation."""
        # Evaluation orchestration logic
```

`EvaluateRunner` remains the orchestration layer. Suite-backed evaluation compiles into it rather than replacing it.

## Framework vs CLI

`aworld.evaluations` owns evaluation semantics:

- suite definitions
- execution-backed compilation
- normalized execution state
- scoring helpers
- report and declared-suite schemas

`aworld-cli` owns product entrypoints:

- `aworld-cli evaluator`
- workspace suite discovery
- report file writing
- evaluator lifecycle hooks for peripheral CLI customization

`aworld-cli evaluator` is now plugin-backed, but the reusable evaluator substrate remains framework-owned.

The intended layering is:

- build evaluator capabilities in `aworld/evaluations/**`
- expose a convenient official entrypoint in `aworld-cli`
- allow other agents or products to reuse the framework substrate without depending on the CLI command shape

## Usage Examples

### Basic Evaluation

```python
from aworld.evaluations.base import EvaluationConfig, EvalDataset, EvalDataCase
from aworld.evaluations.recoder.eval_runner import EvaluateRunner

# Create evaluation config
config = EvaluationConfig(
    eval_target_full_class_name="aworld.evaluations.eval_targets.agent_eval.AworldAgentEvalTarget",
    eval_target_config={"agent_config": {"llm_provider": "openai", "llm_model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo"}},
    eval_dataset_id_or_file_path="path/to/eval_dataset.jsonl",
    eval_criterias=[{"metric_name": "answer_accuracy"}]
)

# Run evaluation
runner = EvaluateRunner()
result = await runner.eval_run(config)
```

### Creating a Custom Scorer

```python
from aworld.evaluations.scorers.scorer_registry import scorer_register
from aworld.evaluations.base import MetricResult, ScorerResult
from aworld.evaluations.scorers.metrics import MetricNames


@scorer_register(MetricNames.CUSTOM_METRIC)
class MyCustomScorer(Scorer):
    async def score(self, index: int, input: EvalDataCase, output: dict) -> ScorerResult:
        # Custom scoring logic
        score_value = ...  # Calculate score
        return ScorerResult(
            scorer_name=self.name,
            metric_results={MetricNames.CUSTOM_METRIC: {"value": score_value}}
        )
```
