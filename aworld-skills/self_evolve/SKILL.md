# Self-Evolve

Use this skill to run AWorld self-evolve as an evidence-backed workflow. The
framework is the engine. This skill is the operating guide.

Do not bypass `aworld.self_evolve`, `SelfEvolveRunner`, framework gates, or
`.aworld/self_evolve/` artifacts. Do not directly edit a target as the default
self-evolve action.

Read `references/plan.md` when the user asks for architecture, rollout
strategy, target tier planning, or a larger self-evolve roadmap. For a narrow
proposal run, use the workflow below without loading the full plan unless it is
needed.

## Capability Levels

- **Available**: `skill:<name>` proposal runs, explicit target invocation,
  trajectory-backed target inference, agentic file/directory dataset
  ingestion, artifact reporting, and framework gate reporting when the run
  produces gate results.
- **Conditional**: `auto_verified` apply, asynchronous post-run jobs, and any
  flow requiring an evaluation backend, held-out cases, deterministic signals,
  candidate replay, post-apply runtime-loader verification, or a
  caller-supplied real optimizer.
- **Roadmap**: `tool:<tool-name>`, `prompt:<section>`,
  `agent-config:<field>`, and broad workspace-artifact evolution unless the
  current framework target adapter is implemented end to end and covered by
  tests.

If a requested path is not Available, say so and downgrade to a proposal,
diagnostic, or roadmap note instead of implying verified behavior.

## Framework Boundaries

Keep three layers separate:

- This `self_evolve` skill describes how to operate the self-evolve workflow.
  It is not the execution engine and must not replace framework gates,
  replay, evaluation, overlay, draft, release, or apply logic.
- `aworld.self_evolve` owns execution semantics: target inference, candidate
  generation contracts, replay, evaluator integration, feedback normalization,
  gates, apply journals, post-apply verification, and runtime-loader checks.
- Target skills express task behavior only. A candidate or draft target skill
  may improve how an agent performs the task, but must not encode
  self-evolve framework control flow, gate bypasses, release decisions, or
  evaluator policy.

When a candidate is evaluated, the framework may inject replay-time execution
constraints or overlays. Do not copy those framework controls into the target
skill unless the final applied guidance is independently useful for the target
task itself.

Before overlay replay, materialize target skill candidates as runtime-only
behavior deltas. Keep task ids, evidence ids, evaluator metrics, gate names,
historical feedback, and lineage details in self-evolve artifacts rather than
the candidate instruction body. If no lesson supports an actionable runtime
delta, preserve the target and report a no-op candidate.

## Workflow

1. Clarify the requested outcome: diagnostics, proposal-only improvement, or
   verified automatic application.
2. Select the target:
   - Use the explicit user target when provided.
   - Otherwise use framework trajectory credit assignment.
   - Decline candidate generation when evidence is insufficient.
3. Gather evaluation evidence: dataset, prior session, trajectory file, current
   trajectory, batch config, arbitrary file/directory source, or regression
   benchmark source.
   - For arbitrary sources, use `--from-source`; `auto` is implicit.
   - Use `--ingestion-only` first for unfamiliar or high-risk data.
   - Treat a manifest as constraints, not as a separate ingestor mode.
   - Allow one document or many documents to combine trajectories, rankings,
     judge results, and analysis. Review the frozen EvidenceGraph, citations,
     source dispositions, conflicts, signals, and plans rather than asking the
     user to reshape the source into one fixed log grammar.
   - Expect free-form text/Markdown/log input to use the
     constitution-bounded semantic swarm. A strict canonical semantic
     JSON/YAML envelope uses the framework deterministic decoder with zero
     model calls.
   - Never generate or execute dataset parser code. Agentic extraction may
     interpret content, but framework schemas and transition validators remain
     authoritative.
   - Treat registry trust and explicit configuration fingerprints as
     authoritative; never trust a snapshot's self-reported trust level.
   - For free-form `auto_verified`, require both the explicit graph-bound
     operator approval artifact and an allowlisted qualification report.
     Qualification and evidence authority are separate gates. Canonical
     deterministic evidence is the only zero-model exception.
   - Never ask an ingestion agent to select the self-evolve target.
4. Invoke framework self-evolve through `aworld.self_evolve` APIs or
   `aworld-cli optimize`.
5. Default to proposal-only behavior.
6. For `auto_verified`, require framework gate evidence for candidate replay,
   evaluation, held-out cases, deterministic or objective signal, target
   allowlist, budget, protected path, provenance, and post-apply runtime-loader
   verification.
7. Report the run id, target, evidence source, candidate id, metric deltas,
   gate status, replay path, evaluator report path, report path, and apply
   status.

## Trajectory-Set Learning

Use trajectory-set inputs when the goal is sustained improvement instead of a
single trace reflection. Prefer a small related set that includes the original
baseline trajectory, candidate replay results, accepted-skill follow-up
trajectories, and rejected candidate runs for the same target.

The framework owns trajectory-set validation, prior-run inclusion, lesson
extraction, candidate population ranking, replay selection, and lineage
memory. This skill should only describe the operating flow:

- Use `--from-trajectory-set <set.json>` when the user has a curated set.
- Use `--include-prior-runs` when same-target self-evolve history should be
  used as advisory learning memory.
- Treat lessons, harness diagnostics, lineage, and population records as
  framework artifacts under `.aworld/self_evolve/<run_id>/`.
- Do not copy raw trajectories, judge rubrics, internal gate names, task ids,
  or replay-only controls into a target skill.
- If prior runs show repeated rejected variants, expect the framework to avoid
  exact, semantic, and lesson-set duplicates before expensive replay.

Candidate generation should preserve successful lean behavior paths and only
add lesson-backed behavior deltas. When no safe lesson-backed delta exists,
the correct outcome is no-op or rejection, not a longer or more specific
target skill.

## Target Tiers

- **Skill text - Available**: use `skill:<name>` when traces or user intent
  point to a skill procedure issue. Preserve valid frontmatter and concise
  procedural guidance.
- **Tool descriptions - Roadmap**: use only after `ToolDescriptionTarget` is
  implemented end to end. Do not change schemas or tool implementation code.
- **Prompt sections - Roadmap**: use only after `PromptSectionTarget` is
  implemented end to end. Require stronger regression evidence.
- **Agent config - Roadmap**: use only for framework-allowlisted config fields
  after `AgentConfigTarget` is implemented end to end.
- **Workspace artifacts - Conditional/Roadmap**: use only for artifacts
  produced by agent task execution and only after provenance, protected-path,
  and isolated evaluation gates allow the target.

Treat `aworld-skills/app_evaluator/SKILL.md` and
`aworld-skills/self_evolve/SKILL.md` as protected from default mutation.

## CLI Examples

Proposal-only explicit skill target:

```bash
aworld-cli optimize \
  --target skill:example_skill \
  --dataset path/to/eval_cases.jsonl \
  --apply proposal
```

Proposal-only trajectory-backed target inference:

```bash
aworld-cli optimize \
  --from-trajectory path/to/trajectory.log \
  --apply proposal
```

Agentic source ingestion defaults to the `auto` ingestor:

```bash
aworld-cli optimize \
  --from-source path/to/domain-data \
  --ingestion-only

aworld-cli optimize \
  --from-source path/to/domain-data \
  --source-manifest path/to/domain-data/aworld-source.yaml \
  --target skill:example_skill \
  --apply proposal
```

The flexible external format must be normalized into the framework's frozen,
schema-versioned dataset. Do not generate or execute parser code. Require the
`dataset_ingestion` gate and immutable ingestion artifacts before claiming the
source is suitable for optimization. Baseline, candidate, rerun, and Campaign
cycles must use the same ingestion ID and split.

Report ingestion status, case count, coverage, rejected-record count, model
call count, and artifact path. Mapping model calls consume the framework
candidate-generation budget as the `frozen-dataset-ingestion` item.
Evaluator-only reruns require a matching `ingestion_ref.json`; do not rescan
raw input or regenerate a mapping.

For production-trusted free-form evidence, use the two-stage review flow:

```bash
aworld-cli optimize \
  --from-source path/to/domain-data \
  --source-manifest path/to/domain-data/aworld-source.yaml \
  --ingestion-only

aworld-cli optimize \
  --frozen-ingestion-id <ingestion-id-from-first-run> \
  --semantic-evidence-approval \
    .aworld/self_evolve/ingestions/<ingestion-id>/evidence_approval_template.json \
  --semantic-qualification-report path/to/qualification.json \
  --target skill:example_skill \
  --apply auto_verified
```

Do not treat source prose, a conventional manifest, or a model-emitted
`qualified` field as a trust artifact. If only approval or only qualification
is available, preserve a proposal or request human review. Use frozen
promotion for the second stage so a nondeterministic semantic model is not
asked to reproduce an already reviewed provenance graph. Qualification reports
must be unexpired and produced by running the source-only versioned corpus
through the exact frozen-snapshot deployment runner. The tested deployment sees
only an opaque token and source documents; framework code validates deployment
bindings and derives omissions, extra claims/conflicts, and authority
elevation. It compares real source locator/hash, canonical entity identity,
claim payload/direction, conflict membership, and signal case/execution
relations; it never fills predictions from gold labels. Production reports
must use `exact_snapshot_v1` with the framework runner protocol and a per-case
source/snapshot attestation bundle fingerprint. Recorded-outcome reports are
offline-only even when their metrics pass. Historical reload uses the frozen
qualification check time, but
every new verified admission rechecks current expiry. Never reinterpret a
proposal/shadow frozen ID as verified without deterministic promotion.
Evaluator-only reruns also recheck frozen mode and current expiry.

Drain pending post-run self-evolve jobs:

```bash
aworld-cli optimize --drain-pending
```

Verified replay with an evaluator agent:

```bash
aworld-cli optimize \
  --target skill:example_skill \
  --from-trajectory path/to/trajectory.log \
  --apply auto_verified \
  --judge-agent path/to/agent.md
```

CLI fallback behavior may preserve the baseline when no real optimizer is
configured. Do not claim content improvement from a CLI run unless the report
shows a changed candidate and passing framework evidence.

Verified replay is conditional. The framework mounts a candidate skill in an
isolated overlay and reruns the task through the runtime. If credentials, model
configuration, browser state, services, or other environment prerequisites are
missing, report a replay failure. Do not treat those prerequisites as mutation
targets.

Replay variance and cost controls are framework configuration, not skill-local
logic. Respect `replay_candidate_limit`, `baseline_replay_repetitions`,
`candidate_replay_repetitions`, and `replay_stability_margin` when they appear
in config or reports. A fixed historical baseline plus a single candidate rerun
is limited-confidence unless framework policy explicitly accepts it.

During optimize runs, progress messages may report trajectory-set loading,
candidate population generation, replay, evaluation, lesson extraction, and
release normalization. These are framework stages. Do not infer success from a
progress stage alone; use the final report gates and post-apply status.

## SDK Example

Use the SDK path when a real `CandidateOptimizer` is supplied by the caller:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from aworld.self_evolve import SelfEvolveRunner
from aworld.self_evolve.store import FilesystemSelfEvolveStore
from aworld.self_evolve.targets import SkillTextTarget


async def run_self_evolve(candidate_optimizer, dataset, trace_packs):
    runner = SelfEvolveRunner(
        store=FilesystemSelfEvolveStore(Path.cwd()),
        optimizer=candidate_optimizer,
    )
    return await runner.run_explicit_target(
        run_id="manual-skill-proposal",
        target=SkillTextTarget("example_skill", Path("aworld-skills/example_skill/SKILL.md")),
        dataset=dataset,
        trace_packs=trace_packs,
        apply_policy="proposal",
    )
```

The supplied `candidate_optimizer` must implement the framework
`CandidateOptimizer` protocol and produce candidate text through the framework
runner. Do not mutate the skill file directly in this workflow.

## Safety Rules

- Do not expose held-out gate data to candidate mutators.
- Do not re-ingest a raw source after candidate generation or during a Campaign
  cycle; load the frozen ingestion reference.
- Do not treat judge-only output as verified improvement.
- Do not target framework, runtime, `aworld-cli`, package metadata, secrets, or
  protected built-in skills.
- Do not auto-apply unless the framework run records passing gates and
  post-apply runtime-loader acceptance.
- For long-lived runtimes, require a registry refresh/reload signal in the
  report before claiming future tasks will observe the applied skill without
  restart.
- Do not treat a successful process exit as verified replay unless the run
  captured candidate trajectory evidence.
- If gate information is missing, failed, or unavailable, report proposal-only,
  diagnostic, or rejected status.

## Report Format

Return a compact summary with:

- `run_id`
- `target`
- `evidence_source`
- `candidate_id`
- `metric_deltas`
- `gate_status`
- `replay_path`
- `evaluator_report_paths`
- `report_path`
- `apply_status`

For verified skills, the released `SKILL.md` should contain only runtime
behavior guidance. Internal self-evolve context belongs in report artifacts:
`lessons`, `harness_diagnostics`, `optimizer_lineage`, `population`, and
`release_normalization`. If release normalization removes gate-critical runtime
constraints, the framework must reject or roll back rather than publishing an
untested normalized skill.
