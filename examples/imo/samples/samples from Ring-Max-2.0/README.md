# Ring-Max-2.0 IMO 2025 Results

This directory contains the execution results and trajectories from running IMO 2025 competition problems using the **[Ring-Max-2.0](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI/Ring-1T)** large language model with the AWorld framework's **solver-grader multi-agent system**.

## Overview

These samples were generated by running `run.py` from the parent directory, solving problems defined in `metadata.jsonl`. For setup and execution instructions, refer to the main [README.md](../README.md).

## Performance Summary

| Metric | Score | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Pass@3** | **5/6** | Problems 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 solved correctly within 3 attempts |

### Problem-Specific Results

- **imo1** (Plane geometry): ✅ Solved on 1st attempt
- **imo2** (Circle and triangle proof): ✅ Solved on 3rd attempt
- **imo3** (Function theory): ✅ Solved on 1st attempt
- **imo4** (Sequence problem): ✅ Solved on 1st attempt
- **imo5** (Game theory): ✅ Solved on 1st attempt
- **imo6** (Grid covering): ❌ Not solved (3 attempts made)

## Directory Structure

Each problem folder (`imo1/` - `imo6/`) contains:

```
imoX/
├── results.json          # Solution trajectory (suitable for LLM fine-tuning)
├── results_tryN.json     # Trajectory from attempt N (for multi-attempt problems)
└── AWorld.log            # Raw execution log with timestamps (verbose)
```

### File Descriptions

- **`results.json`** / **`results_tryN.json`**: Clean trajectory files containing the agent's reasoning process, tool calls, and final answers. These files are structured for downstream use in LLM fine-tuning.
  
- **`AWorld.log`**: Comprehensive execution logs including timestamps, detailed system events, and intermediate states. These logs are verbose and primarily for debugging purposes.

## Usage

### For Fine-Tuning

The `results*.json` files provide high-quality reasoning trajectories that can be used as training samples for fine-tuning large language models on mathematical problem-solving tasks.

### For Analysis

The log files (`AWorld.log`) contain raw execution details for in-depth analysis of the agent's behavior, including timing information and system-level events.

## Notes

- **Multi-attempt problems**: imo2 and imo6 have multiple trajectory files (`results_try1.json`, `results_try2.json`, `results_try3.json`) representing different solving attempts.
- **Evaluation**: Problem 2 (geometry proof) was evaluated by Gemini 2.5 Pro against reference solutions.
- **Model**: All results were generated using [Ring-Max-2.0](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI/Ring-1T) as the base LLM.
- **Framework**: Solutions were produced by the AWorld framework's solver-grader multi-agent architecture.
