# AWorld GUI Agent for OSWorld Benchmark

This repository contains a high-performance GUI agent built on the [AWorld Framework](https://github.com/inclusionAI/AWorld), specifically designed to tackle complex desktop automation tasks within the [OSWorld-verified](https://os-world.github.io/) benchmark. Our agent achieves a **58.04% pass@1 score** on the `osworld-verified` leaderboard (`max_step=50`).

The core logic for our agent's perception and reasoning is adapted from the great work of the [AgentS2 project](https://github.com/simular-ai/Agent-S). We have built upon their foundation by introducing a suite of new executable tools that enhance the agent's ability to interact with the OS environment, leading to significant improvements in the stability and robustness of the Computer Use Agent (CUA).

## 🚀 Performance Highlights

Our agent demonstrates leading performance on the OSWorld-verified benchmark (`max_step=50`), using `openai/o3` as the base model with `temperature=1.0`.

## ⚡️ Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up the environment and reproduce our results.

1.  **Set Up OSWorld Environment**:
    *   First, ensure you have a fully functional OSWorld environment. Please follow the official [OSWorld setup guide](https://github.com/x-spi/osworld) meticulously.

2.  **Install AWorld Framework**:
    *   Install the specific version of `aworld` used in our experiments.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/inclusionAI/AWorld.git
    cd AWorld
    git checkout osworld_benchmark
    python setup.py install
    ```

3.  **Deploy Agent Code**:
    *   Copy the `aworldAgent` folder and the `run_multienv_aworldAgent.py` script into the root directory of your OSWorld project.

4.  **Run the Evaluation Script**:
    *   Our results were achieved using `openai/o3` for reasoning and `bytedance/ui-tars-1.5-7b` for visual grounding, both accessed via OpenRouter.
    *   Activate your conda environment and run the evaluation script. **Remember to replace placeholders like `YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `/path/to/your/vm/Ubuntu.vmx` with your actual credentials and paths.**

    ```bash
    # Activate your OSWorld conda environment (e.g., osworld_env)
    conda activate osworld_env

    # Run the evaluation with the recommended settings
    python run_multienv_aworldAgent.py \
        --model "openai/o3" \
        --model_provider "open_router" \
        --model_url "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1" \
        --model_api_key "YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
        --ground_model "bytedance/ui-tars-1.5-7b" \
        --ground_provider "open_router" \
        --ground_url "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1" \
        --ground_api_key "YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
        --grounding_width 1920 \
        --grounding_height 1080 \
        --provider_name "vmware" \
        --path_to_vm "/path/to/your/vm/Ubuntu.vmx" \
        --client_password "password" \
        --max_steps 50 \
        --num_envs 1 \
        --observation_type "screenshot" \
        --result_dir "./results_aworld_agent_run"
    ```
